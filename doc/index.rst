Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It monitors
execution of the program, noting lines that are executed.  A later analysis
identifies lines that could have been executed but were not.

There are two supported interfaces to coverage: a :ref:`command line <cmd>` and
an :ref:`API <api>`.
