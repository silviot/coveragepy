    - $ make pypi
    - upload the kits:
        - $ allkits.cmd upload
        # note: this seems to try to upload each file twice, so you'll have a
        # successful upload, then a failure, but the file gets there.

* Building

- Create PythonXX\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg::
    [build]
    compiler = mingw32

* Testing

(automate these someday)

- On Py 2.x: need setuptools installed
- On Py 3.x: need Distribute installed
- Need nose installed
- Need to have coverage dev-installed
- In each Python installation to be used, create a "coverage_test_egg.pth"
  containing::

    c:\ned\coverage\trunk\test\eggsrc\dist\covtestegg1-0.0.0-py2.5.egg

  (or equivalent).

  These go in c:\python26\lib\site-packages or
  /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages, for example.

- For complete coverage testing, in each Python installation, create a
  "zzz_coverage_process_start.pth" containing::

    import coverage; coverage.process_startup()
