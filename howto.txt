- Update PyPi:
    - $ make pypi
    - upload the kits:
        - $ allkits.cmd upload
        # note: this seems to try to upload each file twice, so you'll have a
        # successful upload, then a failure, but the file gets there.
    - Visit http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=pkg_edit&name=coverage :
        - show/hide the proper versions.
- Tag the tree

    # with that number.
- Announce on TIP.
- Ask Christophe Zwerschke (cito@online.de) to build win64 kits.


* Building

- Create PythonXX\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg::
    [build]
    compiler = mingw32

* Testing

(automate these someday)

- On Py 2.x: need setuptools installed
- On Py 3.x: need Distribute installed
- Need nose installed
    - nose for py 2.x
    - nose3 for py 3.x
        - copy Scripts\nosetest3.exe to Scripts\nosetests.exe
        - copy Scripts\nosetest3-script.py to Scripts\nosetests-script.py
- Need to have coverage dev-installed
- In each Python installation to be used, create a "coverage_test_egg.pth"
  containing::

    c:\ned\coverage\trunk\test\eggsrc\dist\covtestegg1-0.0.0-py2.5.egg

  (or equivalent).

  These go in c:\python26\lib\site-packages or
  /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages, for example.

- For complete coverage testing, in each Python installation, create a
  "zzz_coverage_process_start.pth" containing::

    import coverage; coverage.process_startup()
