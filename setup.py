# setup.py for coverage.

"""Code coverage measurement for Python

Coverage measures code coverage, typically during test execution.  It uses the
code analysis tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python standard library
to determine which lines are executable, and which have been executed.

Code repository is at `bitbucket.org <http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy>`_.
